# Data-Structures
This repository contains assignments I did as a part of a course I took on Data Structures and Algorithms.


Assignment-1 contains multiplication of binary numbers using Na√Øve [O(n<sup>2</sup>)] and Karatsuba [O(n<sup>log<sub>2</sub>3</sup>)] Algorithms.

Assignment-2 is about implementation of Dynamics Arrays and then using it for the implementation of Stacks and Queues.

Assignment-3 takes input a directed graph and outputs whether the given directed graph is "**atleast one way connected or not**".

Assignment-4: 
Problem: Given integers R<sub>1</sub>......R<sub>n</sub> and C<sub>1</sub>.....C<sub>n</sub>, implement an algorithm that determines
if there exists an nXn 0/1 matrix A such that for all i and j :
